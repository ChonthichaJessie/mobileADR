# Decision record for Choosing the Right App
---
## Status
Approved

## Context
Team is considering whether to develop native, web, or hybrid apps.
- Native apps are applications that are designed specifically for a particular operating system and written in the OS's native programming language.
- Web apps are designed to run in a web browser and are simple to create, but they are limited by the browser's capabilities.
- Hybrid apps can function in multiple environments, strike a good balance between the two, and are often the most cost-effective option.

## Decision
The team agreed to develop the application under native apps. According to native apps, they are the most powerful applications, improving performance, user experience, and access to device features. They give you more control over the UI/UX and enable seamless integration with device features like GPS for location tracking and push notifications. In addition, native development allows for platform-specific optimizations and faster feature execution.

## Consequence
We anticipate the following outcomes and consequences of our decision:
### Positive
- Better performance; faster, more responsive, more reliable data protection
- Enhanced user experience; much more intuitive and interactive user experience because people are familiar with the layouts typical for their operating system 
### Negative
- The engineering process is time consuming and requires more effort.
- High development cost
