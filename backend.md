# Decision record for Backend language
---
## Status
Approved

## Context
The team was looking for a back-end language for application development that was high in performance and could support application features in real time. They also expected the language to be less complicated in order to avoid time-consuming issues, as they assumed that developers would spend a significant amount of time developing the front end.

## Decision
The team chose Node.js as the back-end language because it offers high performance for real-time applications and the ability to multitask; its event-driven architecture efficiently processes multiple concurrent requests without clogging RAM. Furthermore, its event-loop and non-blocking I/O operations enable fast code execution, which improves the application's overall performance.

## Consequence
We anticipate the following outcomes and consequences of our decision:
### Positive
- Provides fast delivery, easy scalability
- Quick to adapt & easy to learn
