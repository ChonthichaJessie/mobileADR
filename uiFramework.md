# Decision record for UI Framework
---
## Status
Approved

## Context
After deciding to develop a native application, the team needed to find a suitable UI framework to ensure that it provides seamless and consistent user experiences while also saving time for developers.

## Decision
Team agreed to use React Native framework to develop the application. React Native can speed up development by allowing you to build for both iOS and Android at the same time. It allows for code reuse across both iOS and Android platforms, reducing development time and effort. With a large community and extensive library support, React Native provides a robust ecosystem for developing visually appealing and responsive user interfaces.

## Consequence
We anticipate the following outcomes and consequences of our decision:
### Positive
- Code reuse saves time and eliminates the need for developers to create separate codes for each platform.
- Strong community support - Third-party plugins reduce development costs by eliminating the need to build an application from scratch.
### Negative
- Requires React Native expertise 
- Compatibility and debugging issues may result in spending a lot of time.
